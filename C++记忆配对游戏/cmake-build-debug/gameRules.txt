RULES + How to Play the game
Objective:
Score the most points by finding and matching pairs of cards.

Setup:
Use cards numbered 1 to 100 (two of each number, 200 cards total).
Shuffle and place them face down in rows.

Gameplay:
Players take turns in clockwise order.
On your turn, you may:
Flip two cards:
If the numbers match → you score +10 points and keep the pair. You may take another turn.
If they don’t match → you lose -5 points. The cards are flipped back face down. Turn ends.
Pass your turn:
You score -2 points.
Scoring:
Match = +10 points
Mismatch = -5 points
Pass = -2 points
Keep a written score tally.
Winning:
The game ends when all pairs are matched.
The winner is the player with the highest total points.
If scores tie, the player with the most pairs matched wins.

Tips:
Remember the position of revealed cards.
Passing strategically can sometimes prevent bigger losses.
